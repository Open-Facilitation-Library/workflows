# Cynefin Company & SenseMaker: AI Developments

*Research date: 2026-02-17*

## Summary

No AI replacement for SenseMaker is being built. The Cynefin Company's philosophy is explicitly against replacing human sensemaking with AI. Their core principle is **self-signification** — people interpret their own narratives, without AI or researchers imposing meaning (what they call "epistemic justice").

However, AI-augmented features are being added around the edges.

## Key Developments

### Virtual Hexi Assembly with AI

Announced as forthcoming (before April 2025). Uses AI to help optimize Hexi configurations — not to interpret narratives. This is the closest thing to an AI-powered tool from the Cynefin Company.

### "The Caterpillar"

Teased by Dave Snowden in a [February 2025 blog post](https://thecynefin.co/2025-our-21st-anniversary/) alongside "a new brainstorming and discovery tool around Hexi." No further public details found.

### QuickSense Products

Ready-to-deploy sensemaking packages that gather narratives over 3 months with weekly reports:
- QuickSense for Culture
- AI & Agile Culture assessment
- Custom QuickSense design for third parties

Not AI-powered per se, but productized SenseMaker workflows.

### TGN Consulting Partnership (Jan 2026)

[Strategic partnership](https://www.tgn-consulting.com/the-cynefin-company-announces-strategic-partnership-with-tgn-consulting-for-sensemaker-distribution) for SenseMaker distribution in North America, explicitly to help organizations navigate "AI-driven transformations."

### Hexi Facilitation Kits

Physical toolkits based on Estuarine mapping methodology. The Estuarine Hexi kit was released in early 2025 — a brainstorming/strategic prioritization tool.

## SenseMaker's Stance on AI

From the [official blog post](https://thecynefin.co/sensemaker-algorithms-ai/):

- SenseMaker does **not** use AI, ML, or LLMs by default
- Algorithms used are mathematical, based solely on project data — no external training data
- Self-signification via Triads, Dyads, and Stones is the core methodology
- Users *could* apply AI tools to secondary analysis, but "discretion strongly advised"
- Snowden: "It's no secret that over the last two decades, we have used AI but sought not to be used by it"
- Concession: "there is considerable value in various forms of algorithmic and mechanical augmentation of human decision-making, including LLMs"
- Warning: "anthropomorphising them as intelligent is deeply problematic"

## Relevance to OFL Workflows

SenseMaker is **not** an AI facilitation tool and does not meet the inclusion criteria for the workflows repo (no AI agent actively conducting, guiding, or mediating a group process). The Hexi + AI developments are worth monitoring but are not yet public enough to document.

If the Virtual Hexi Assembly with AI or the Caterpillar ship with genuine AI facilitation capabilities, they could be added as a workflow.
