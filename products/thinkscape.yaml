description: >
  Conversational Swarm Intelligence platform that splits large groups into
  networked small teams (ThinkTanks of 5-7 people), assigns an AI "Conversational
  Surrogate" to each tank, and propagates insights across the network in real time.

agents:
  - id: surrogate
    role: Conversational Surrogate
    type: llm
    description: >
      One AI agent per ThinkTank. Observes the local conversation, identifies
      key insights, shares them with peer surrogates, and introduces
      cross-group insights conversationally into its own tank.
    responsibilities:
      - Monitor local ThinkTank conversation
      - Identify key insights and positions
      - Share insights with peer surrogates (other ThinkTanks)
      - Introduce cross-group insights into local conversation
      - Express ideas conversationally (not as summaries)

  - id: orchestrator
    role: Network Orchestrator
    type: system
    description: >
      Manages the fully-connected network of surrogates. Coordinates insight
      propagation timing and monitors convergence across the swarm.
    responsibilities:
      - Divide participants into ThinkTanks
      - Manage surrogate-to-surrogate communication
      - Monitor network-wide convergence
      - Track sentiment and preference shifts

participants:
  input_mode: text
  interaction: small-group  # 5-7 per ThinkTank, but many tanks in parallel
  synchronicity: sync
  scale:
    min: 14
    max: 400
    typical: 100
  anonymity: false

stages:
  - name: Group Formation
    description: Divide participants into ThinkTanks of 5-7 people
    agent: orchestrator
    input:
      - Participant list
      - Optional: demographic/expertise data
    processing: Assign participants to balanced ThinkTanks
    memory: []
    output:
      - ThinkTank assignments
      - One surrogate agent per tank
    duration: automated
    human_in_loop: false

  - name: Local Deliberation
    description: Small groups discuss the topic in their ThinkTank
    agent: surrogate
    input:
      - Discussion prompt
      - Participant messages within the ThinkTank
    processing: >
      Participants chat naturally in small group. Surrogate observes,
      identifies emerging insights and positions.
    memory:
      - Local conversation history
      - Discussion prompt
    output:
      - Local conversation transcript
      - Identified local insights
    duration: "5-10 min"
    human_in_loop: false

  - name: Cross-Tank Propagation
    description: Surrogates share insights across the network
    agent: surrogate
    input:
      - Local insights from own ThinkTank
      - Insights received from peer surrogates
    processing: >
      Surrogate packages key local insights and sends to all peer surrogates.
      Receives insights from other tanks. Introduces cross-group ideas
      conversationally into local discussion (as a participant, not a moderator).
    memory:
      - Local conversation context
      - Insights from all other ThinkTanks
    output:
      - Cross-pollinated ideas introduced to local group
      - Network-wide insight map
    duration: continuous (overlaps with local deliberation)
    human_in_loop: false

  - name: Convergence Monitoring
    description: Track opinion alignment across the full network
    agent: orchestrator
    input:
      - All ThinkTank conversations
      - Surrogate-to-surrogate communications
    processing: >
      Monitor sentiment shifts, preference convergence, and idea adoption
      across the network. Detect when the swarm reaches sufficient alignment.
    memory:
      - Full network state
      - Historical convergence trajectory
    output:
      - Convergence metrics
      - Network-wide preference map
      - Decision readiness indicator
    duration: continuous
    human_in_loop: false

  - name: Collective Output
    description: Aggregate final positions across all ThinkTanks
    agent: orchestrator
    input:
      - Final positions from each ThinkTank
      - Convergence metrics
    processing: Compile network-wide consensus and remaining disagreements
    memory:
      - All ThinkTank transcripts
      - Convergence data
    output:
      - Collective decision or recommendation
      - Areas of consensus and dissent
      - Analytics dashboard
    duration: automated
    human_in_loop: false

data_flow:
  inputs:
    - Discussion prompt / decision question
  outputs:
    - Collective decision or recommendation
    - Convergence analytics
    - Per-ThinkTank transcripts
  storage:
    - ThinkTank conversation logs
    - Surrogate-to-surrogate message logs
    - Convergence metrics

patterns:
  - cross-pollination  # via surrogate insight propagation

evaluation:
  metrics:
    - Group IQ amplification (vs individual performance)
    - Convergence speed
    - Insight propagation rate (how fast ideas spread)
    - Participant satisfaction
    - Decision quality (vs expert benchmark)
