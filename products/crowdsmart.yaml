description: >
  Generative Collective Intelligence (GCI) platform using a Collective Reasoning
  Agent to orchestrate structured human-AI collaboration. Participants evaluate
  ideas via pairwise comparison (Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment),
  with identity masking and adaptive peer review to prevent manipulation.
  Produces prioritized rankings and a private language model of deliberations.

agents:
  - id: collective-reasoning-agent
    role: Collective Reasoning Agent
    type: hybrid
    description: >
      Central orchestrator that facilitates structured collaboration while
      maintaining anonymity and preventing manipulation. Uses four key
      mechanisms: identity masking, adaptive peer review selection,
      iterative refinement, and causal model building.
    responsibilities:
      - Mask participant identities and scores (merit-based engagement)
      - Adaptively select items for peer review (prevent gaming/groupthink)
      - Facilitate iterative refinement cycles of judgment and feedback
      - Build causal models capturing shared understanding
      - Create comprehensive audit trail of knowledge construction

  - id: pairwise-engine
    role: Pairwise Comparison Engine
    type: system
    description: >
      Implements Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment for preference
      aggregation. Participants compare pairs of alternatives; aggregated
      results infer collective preference ordering via maximum likelihood
      estimation, Bayesian mechanics, or Hidden Markov Models.
    responsibilities:
      - Present pairwise comparisons to participants
      - Aggregate comparative judgments into preference orderings
      - Apply probabilistic inference (MLE, Bayesian, HMM)
      - Implement Minimum Regret Principle for decision selection

  - id: deliberation-model
    role: Private Deliberation Model
    type: llm
    description: >
      A private language model built from the group's deliberations. Unlike
      large general models, it contains only information from the deliberation
      process, making it fully provenanced and trustworthy. Queryable via
      conversational AI.
    responsibilities:
      - Capture group deliberations in a private language model
      - Ensure full provenance and trustworthiness
      - Enable conversational querying of collective intelligence
      - Maintain audit trail of knowledge construction

stages:
  - name: Problem Alignment
    description: Group clarifies and agrees on the challenge
    agent: collective-reasoning-agent
    input:
      - Initial problem statement
      - Participant perspectives on the challenge
    processing: >
      Surface diverse framings of the problem with masked identities.
      Build shared understanding before solution-seeking.
    memory:
      - Initial problem statement
      - Participant perspectives
    output:

    description: Collective idea contribution with iterative refinement
    agent: collective-reasoning-agent
    input:
      - Aligned problem definition
      - Participant ideas (submitted anonymously)
    processing: >
      Collect ideas with masked identities. AI surfaces patterns and
      connections. Iterative refinement through cycles of judgment
      and feedback. Adaptive selection of ideas for peer review
      prevents gaming and groupthink.
    memory:
      - Aligned problem definition
      - All submitted ideas

  - name: Pairwise Evaluation
    description: Comparative judgment to rank solutions
    agent: pairwise-engine
    input:
      - Refined idea set
      - Participant pairwise comparisons (A vs B)
    processing: >
      Participants compare pairs of alternatives. Aggregated results
      infer collective preference ordering via probabilistic methods
      (MLE, Bayesian, HMM). Minimum Regret Principle guides final
      selection (multi-armed bandit extended to social learning).
    memory:

      - All deliberation data (ideas, comparisons, refinements)
      - Causal models
    processing: >
      Construct private language model containing only the group's
      deliberation content. Fully provenanced — no external data leakage.
